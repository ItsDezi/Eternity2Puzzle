The 4x4 and 7x7 .txt files were acquired from David Barr at https://github.com/david3x3x3
Source for memory and runtime measurements from https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaPerformance/article.html

To get a better visual representation of the backtracking in action,
go to line 344 in the board files, and un-comment the print statement.
This will show the board updating in real time. BUT be aware that this
will increase the runtime of the program significantly (but it looks WAY cooler :) ).

We acknowledge that this is our own original work.

Thank you for a great semester.

Enjoy!
